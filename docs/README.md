### What's in here
This folder currently has a mixed purpose:
- Home for the documentation
- The source for the root of _state machine cat_'s on line version that's available on https://state-machine-cat.js.org
(and [on gitlab.io](https://sverweij.gitlab.io/state-machine-cat)) - `docs` is the folder github
uses as the root of any github pages page (what state-machine-cat.js.org runs on)

### Dependency graph

Click on the image for a slightly more interactive version that (a.o.) navigates you
to a source file when you click on it. The graph omits any external dependencies to
remain concise.
