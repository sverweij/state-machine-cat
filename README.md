## What?
Makes this

<img width="853" alt="docs/pics/sample.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/sample.png">

from this
```smcat
initial,
doing: entry/ write unit test
       do/ write code
       exit/ ...,
# smcat recognizes initial
# and final states by name
# and renders them appropriately
final;

initial      => "on backlog" : item adds most value;
"on backlog" => doing        : working on it;
doing        => testing      : built & unit tested;
testing      => "on backlog" : test not ok;
testing      => final        : test ok;
```

## Why
To enable me to make state charts ...
- ... that look _good_
- ... with the least effort possible
- ... whithout having to interact with drag and drop tools. Entering text
  is fine, doing my own layout is not.
- ... without having to dive into GraphViz `dot` each time. GraphViz is cool,
  but is was not designed to write & maintain conceptual documents in
  (_You'll know what I'm talking about if you ever tried to get it to draw nested nodes. Or edges between those._ )

## Usage

### On line
A no-frills interpreter on line: [state-machine-cat.js.org](https://state-machine-cat.js.org).

### Within the Atom editor
There's an [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/state-machine-cat-preview)
with syntax highlighting, a previewer and some export options. You can install
it from within Atom (search for _state machine cat_ in the _install_ section
of the settings screen) or use `apm i state-machine-cat-preview`
if you're a command line person.

OTOH. if you're a command line person the _command line interface_ might be
something for you too:

### Command line interface
Just `npm install --global state-machine-cat` and run `smcat`

This is what `smcat --help` would get you:

```
Usage: smcat [options] [infile]

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -T --output-type <type>     svg|dot|smcat|json|ast|html|scxml|scjson (default: "svg")
  -I --input-type <type>      smcat|json (default: "smcat")
  -E --engine <type>          dot|circo|fdp|neato|osage|twopi (default: "dot")
  -d --direction <dir>        top-down|bottom-top|left-right|right-left (default: "top-down")
  -o --output-to <file>       File to write to. use - for stdout.
  --dot-graph-attrs <string>  graph attributes to pass to the dot render engine
  --dot-node-attrs <string>   node attributes to pass to the dot render engine
  --dot-edge-attrs <string>   edge attributes to pass to the dot render engine
  -l --license                Display license and exit
  -h, --help                  output usage information
```

... so to convert the above chart to `sample.svg`

```sh
bin/smcat docs/sample.smcat
```

Or, if you'd rather have the native GraphViz dot do that for you:

```sh
bin/smcat -T dot docs/sample.smcat -o - | dot -T svg -odoc/sample.svg
```

Leaving the options at the default settings usually deliver the best
results already, so if they bewilder you: don't worry.

The `--dot-graph-attrs` (and the node and edge variants thereof) exist in case you want
to override default attributes in the generated picture; e.g. to get a transparent background
and draw edges as line segments instead of splines, use this:

```sh
bin/smcat --dot-graph-attrs "bgcolor=transparent splines=line" docs/sample.smcat
```

### State chart XML (SCXML)
_state machine cat_ can emit a valid core constructs 
[scxml](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) document. If you're into that sort
of thing you can read all about it in [State Machine Cat and SCXML](./docs/SCXML.md).

### Programmatically
After you `npm i` 'd `state-machine-cat`:

```javascript
const smcat = require("state-machine-cat");

try {
    const lSVGInAString = smcat.render(
        `
            initial => backlog;
            backlog => doing;
            doing => test;
        `,
        {
            outputType: "svg"
        }
    );
    console.log(lSVGInAString);
} catch (pError) {
    console.error(pError);
}
```

## The language

### Short tutorial

#### simplest
```smcat
on => off;
```
<img width="206" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/00simplest.png">

- _smcat_ automatically declares the states. You _can_ explicitly declare
  them if you want them to have more than a name only - see _state
  declarations_ below.

#### labels
```smcat
on => off: switch;
```
<img width="251" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/01labels.png">

UML prescribes to place _conditions_ after _events_, to place
_conditions_ within squares and to place _actions_
after a `/`: `from => to: event [conditions]/ actions`, e.g. `on => off: switch flicked [not an emergency]/ light off;`.

You're free to do so, but _smcat_ doesn't check for it. It internally takes
the notation into account, though and if you choose to export to json, scxml
or scjson you'll see them nicely split out.
```smcat
on => off: switch flicked/
           light off;
off => on: switch flicked/
           light on;
```

<img width="202" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/01labels_better.png">

> You note that smcat rendered the states in this chart _top down_ instead of
> _left to right_. It did that because we told it so. You can do that too
> with `--direction` on the command line, or in atom  by `direction -> left
> to right` or `direction -> top down` from the chart's submenu.


#### notes
```smcat
# this is a note
on => off;
```
<img width="284" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/02notes.png">

#### state declarations
If you need to define activities (e.g. `entry` or `exit` triggers) on
a state, you can explicitly declare the state and put the activites
after a colon:

```smcat
# yep, notes get rendered here as well
# multiple notes translate into multiple
# lines in notes in the diagram
doing: 
  entry/ make a feature branch
  exit/ deploy code on production
  ...;
```
<img width="521" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/04explicit_state_declarations.png">

_smcat_ recognizes the `entry/` and `exit/` keywords and treats 
everything after it on the same line to be the 'body' of the
trigger.

Here too: you're free to use them, but you don't _have_ to. 
_smcat_ takes them into account in its internal representation
and uses them in exports to json, scxml and scjson.

#### state display names
If you want to use a display names that differ from how you
name the states (e.g. if the display names are long),
you can do so by adding a label to them:

```smcat
on [label="Lamp aan"],
off [label="Lamp uit"];

off => on: on pushed;
on => off: off pushed;
```

<img width="320" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/09labeled_states.png">

#### `initial` and `final`
When `initial` or `final`, is part of a state's name _smcat_ treats
it as the UML 'pseudo states' `initial` and `final` respectively:
```smcat
initial => todo;
todo    => doing;
doing   => done;
done    => final;
```
<img width="473" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/03initial_and_final.png">

#### `history`
_smcat_ recognizes states with `history` in their name als history states:
```smcat
initial,
"power off",
running {  
  running.history;

  washing -> rinsing: 20 min;
  rinsing -> spinning: 20 min;
  spinning -> final: 20 min;
},
final;

initial => washing;
running => "power off": power out;
"power off" => running.history: restore power;
```

<img width="941" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/07history.png">

History states are _shallow_ by default. If you want a history state to
be _deep_ just put that somewhere in the name (e.g. `"running deep history"`
or `running.history.deep`) - and smcat will render them as such.

#### Choice - `^`
_smcat_ treats states starting with `^` as UML pseudo state _choice_. Strictly
speaking 'choice' is a superfluous element of the UML state machine
specification, but it is there and sometimes it makes diagrams easier to read.

```smcat
^fraud?: transaction fraudulent?;

initial -> reserved;
reserved -> quoted:
    quote
    requested;
quoted -> ^fraud?: payment;
^fraud? -> ticketed: [no];
^fraud? -> removed: [yes];
ticketed -> final;
removed -> final;
```

<img width="710" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/03achoice.png">

#### Forks and joins - `]`
In UML you can fork state transitions into multiple or join them into one
with the _fork_ and _join_ pseudo states. Both of them are represented by
a black bar. To make a _join_ or _fork_ pseudo state, start its name with a `]`.
Here's an example of a _join_:

```smcat
a => ]join;
b => ]join;
]join => c;
```

<img width="267" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/03bforkjoin.png">

#### Gotchas
- when you need `;`, `,`, `{`, `[` or spaces as part of a state - place em in quotes
    `"a state"`
- Activities have the same restriction, except they allow spaces.
- Labels have the same restriction as activities, except they allow for `,` too.
- State declaration precedence is: deep wins from shallow; explicit wins from
  implicit
- It's possible to declare the same state multiple times on the same level, buts
  smcat will take the last declaration into account only. For example:

This
```
# first declaration of "cool state"
"cool state",
"other state",
# second declaration of "cool state"
"cool state": cool down;
```
results in (/ is equivalent to):
```
# second declaration of "cool state"
"cool state": cool down,
"other state";
```

#### nested state machines
It's possible to have state machines _within_ states.
the states _stopped_, _playing_ and _pause_ can only occur when
the tape player is on:
```
initial,
"tape player off",
"tape player on" {
  stopped => playing : play;
  playing => stopped : stop;
  playing => paused  : pause;
  paused  => playing : pause;
  paused  => stopped : stop;
};

initial           => "tape player off";
"tape player off" => stopped           : power;
"tape player on"  => "tape player off" : power;
```
<img width="821" alt="rendition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/05tape_player.png">

#### parallel states
If stuff is happening in parallel within a state you can express 
that too. Just make sure the state has the word "parallel" in there:

```smcat
initial,
bla.parallel {
    first{
        first.thing -> first.thang;
    },
    second{
        second.thing -> second.thang;
        second.thang -> second.thing;
    };
},
final;

initial -> ]split;
]split  -> first.thing;
]split  -> second.thing;
first.thang  -> ]merge;
second.thang -> ]merge;
]merge  -> final;
```
<img width="742" alt="parallel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/08parallel.png">

#### marking states as _active_
You can mark one or more states as active by adding `active` as an
attribute for that state e.g. to make the `do` state an active one
do this:

```smcat
do [active];

initial -> plan;
plan    -> do;
do      -> study;
study   -> act;
act     -> plan;
```

which will result in

<img width="531" alt="parallel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/11active_state.png">

#### colors
As of version 4.2.0 state-machine-cat has (experimental) support for colors on both
states and transitions.

For example, this ...
```smcat
eat   [color="#008800"],
sleep [color="blue" active],
meow  [color="red"],
play  [color="purple"];

sleep -> meow  [color="red"]    : wake up;
meow  -> meow  [color="red"]    : no response from human;
meow  -> eat   [color="#008800"]: human gives food;
meow  -> play  [color="purple"] : human gives toy;
play  -> sleep [color="blue"]   : tired or bored; 
eat   -> sleep [color="blue"]   : belly full;
```

... would yield this diagram:
<img width="739" alt="colored states and transitions" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/master/docs/pics/10colored_states_and_transitions.png">

What does 'experimental' mean?
> The color attribute is probably here to stay.    
> 
> However, I haven't found the balance between ease of use
> and expressiveness yet. Should the text in a state be rendered in the same color?
> should the background color automatically be rendered as well? In the same color,
> or in a shade smartly derived? Or should I include a bunch of color attributes
> (e.g. fillcolor, textcolor, textbgcolor) for ultimate control?

#### grammar
I made the parser with pegjs - you can find it at
[src/parse/peg/smcat-parser.pegjs](src/parse/peg/smcat-parser.pegjs)

## Status
- Thoroughly tested and good enough for public use.
- Despite this you might bump into the occasional issue - don't hesitate to
  report it, either on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/issues)
  or on [GitHub](https://github.com/sverweij/state-machine-cat/issues).
- Runs on latest versions of firefox, safari and chrome and node versions >= 6.
  Although it might run on other environments, it's not tested there. I will
  reject issues on these other environments, unless they're accompanied with
  sufficient enticement to make it worth my while.
